# PWA Budget Tracker

## Description 
This application is for enabling a user to add deposits and deduct expenses in to their budget. This can be accomplished both with and without a network connection, and any information entered while offline will update in to the tracker once a connection is established again. The application is also a PWA, meaning it can be interacted with as if it is native to their device, and is able to load without a network connection.
